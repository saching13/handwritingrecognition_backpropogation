# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project involves building a machine learning model for hand written digit recognition using backpropogation using
 minimal preprocessing and neurons. It's implementation was based on a [research paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-90c.pdf)
 
 
 ## Dataset:
   The dataset used is a MNSIT dataset which contains training set of 60,000 and a test set of 10,000 grayscale
   Images of resolution 28 x 28
   
   Data set link: [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
   
   To train the model download the dataset from the above link and place them in project directory and run the [Train.py]()
   
   Train.py will create a model file which can be loaded and tested using [test.py]()
